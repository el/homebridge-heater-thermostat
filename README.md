# Homebridge Pi Thermostat Plugin

This is a [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin to make a Raspberry Pi connected with a Relay Board and DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor into a smart thermostat that can be controlled via the Home app on iOS using Homekit. This plugin only supports Heaters.

You can use homebridge config-x UI to configure this plugin.
